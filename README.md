# Solving-HSP-NHSP
This repository contains algorithms that solve both the HSP and the NHSP problems under certain conditions. These algorithms yield a cryptanalysis of the quantum money scheme proposed by Scott Aaronson and Paul Christiano ("Quantum Money from Hidden Subspaces", STOC 2012).

The file hsp.mgm contains the source code of the algorithms regarding the HSP, while the file nhsp.mgm has the source
code concerning the NHSP.
